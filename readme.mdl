This project is my first self written and designed website using only HTML & CSS.
The website is a digital resume for employment purposes.
It makes use of images, css grids, flexboxes, forms, media queries and more.

A dark theme toggle has been retroactively added using javascript (see script.js).
It's still a work in progress, but works well enough as is.
